Hello,

I have styled the user interface specifically for a resolution of 1440px. 
I haven't implemented any media queries for mobile, tablet, or desktop devices.
While creating this layout, I adhered to the UI style guide. 
However, I noticed that some measurements were not appropriate. 
To address this, I decided to adjust the spacing and distances based on visual aesthetics, deviating slightly from strict adherence to percentage-based units.





STRUCTURE
- The structure is divided in folders each folder between 1 to 12 are following the submission requests:

Regarding the animations on the landing page:

For the "OUR PRODUCTS" section, I implemented a typing script animation to enhance the user experience.
In the JavaScript functionality for the cards, I programmed a feature where clicking on a card changes its shadow to red momentarily. 
The shadow reverts to its default state after 2 seconds.
